# Remote-Control-Outlet-Switch
This is an app I made to control my lights in the living room and the dining room. The app makes HTTP requests to a custom made smart outlet that I wired together using a relay switch and an raspberry pi zero. The code for my smart outlet can be found here: https://github.com/jtpunt/Automated-Gardening/tree/master/Relay%20Server
